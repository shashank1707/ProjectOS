# How to work

- Create a new branch for your files.
- Work only in the new branch until your code is complete.
- Merge the new branch with your team branch then delete the temporary branch.
- Check if there are any conflicting files. Resolve the errors. 
- It is recommended that only one person should work on one file. (to minimize conflicting codes)
- We will merge all the files into the master branch in the end.


- Do not change other Team's Files or main.dart
- It is recommended to keep a copy of the project in your local device.
